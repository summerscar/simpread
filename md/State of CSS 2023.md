> The 2023 edition of the annual survey about the latest trends in the CSS ecosystem.

CSS is going through a period of unprecedented progress. Between `:has()`, container queries, subgrid, and many more, new features are making their way to browsers seemingly every month.

The consequence of all this growth is that things can get a bit overwhelming. Thankfully this year we had [Chen Hui Jing](https://chenhuijing.com/) to help design the survey and guide us through the CSS jungle.

And speaking of the survey, did you know browser vendors use its data as part of the [Interop](https://web.dev/interop-2023/) initiative to help prioritize which features to work on next?

Finally, we are introducing a new feature this year: the ability to **customize charts** with your own data filters. We're excited to see what kind of new insights you'll come up with!
