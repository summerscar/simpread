Introducing DDIR Companion App

Why I built it?
---------------

When I first tried to dive deeper into React in 2021, I drew myself [a few diagrams](https://github.com/JSerZANP/react-source-code-walkthrough-en/blob/main/memo/) to help myself understand React internals, below is one of them.

Obviously it is a lot of manual effort and also it is just a static image, what if we can visualize React internals automatically and make it dynamic? I had this idea of visualization tool in my mind for a long time, and finally I made it happen.

How to use it?
--------------

The UI of [RIE(React Internals Explorer)](https://jser.pro/ddir/rie) should be straightforward, basically you can

1.  Choose React version (currently supporting 18.3.1 and 19-rc)
2.  Edit your code or choose the built-in snippet
3.  Click the ‚ÄúRun‚Äù button to inspect the React internals
4.  Interact with the preview and see the the internal updates.

For example you can choose ‚ÄúSuspense - multi throw‚Äù snippet and see how React@19 and React@18 handle things differently

Maybe it is easier to watch my quick intro video. üò≥

Next steps.
-----------

[RIE(React Internals Explorer)](https://jser.pro/ddir/rie) is still in early stage, as companion app for [DDIR(Deeper Dive Into React)](https://jser.pro/ddir), I‚Äôll try to cover more flows and make it easier to use.

If you have better idea or bug reports, please drop me a message.
