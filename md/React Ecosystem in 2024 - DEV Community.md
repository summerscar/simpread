15. Type Checking
-----------------

TypeScript is a programming language developed by Microsoft that extends JavaScript by adding static types. It offers comprehensive type checking and a robust type system to catch errors during development and improve code quality. Here are some key aspects of type checking in TypeScript:

1.  **Static Type System**: TypeScript introduces a static type system, which means that types are checked at compile time. This helps identify type-related errors before the code is executed.
2.  **Type Annotations**: Developers can specify the types of variables, function parameters, and return values using type annotations. This provides clarity and ensures that variables are used consistently.
3.  **Inference**: TypeScript can infer types based on the value assigned to a variable. This reduces the need for explicit type annotations and improves code conciseness.
4.  **Type Declarations**: TypeScript supports the declaration of custom types, such as interfaces and enums, to define the shape of data structures and enhance code maintainability.
5.  **Type Compatibility**: TypeScript has a system for checking type compatibility, which ensures that you can't assign incompatible types to variables. This helps prevent common runtime errors.
6.  **Type Checking JavaScript Files**: TypeScript can also check JavaScript files, allowing you to gradually introduce TypeScript into existing JavaScript projects.

By incorporating TypeScript into your development workflow, you can benefit from these type checking features to catch errors early, enhance code maintainability, and improve the overall quality of your code. You can learn more about TypeScript and its type checking capabilities on the [official TypeScript website](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

16. Mobile Apps
